Slip39 is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 3 (or later)
and is also available under alternative licenses negotiated directly with
Dominion Research & Development Corp.  If you obtained slip39 under the GPL,
then the GPL applies to all slip39 modules used on your system as well, except
as defined below. The GPL (version 3) is included in this source tree in the
file COPYING.

Dominion Research & Development Corp. holds copyright and/or sufficient
licenses to all components of the slip39 package, and therefore can grant, at
its sole discretion, the ability for companies, individuals, or organizations
to create proprietary or Open Source (even if not GPL) modules which may use at
runtime the portions of slip39 which fall under our copyright/license umbrella,
or are distributed under more flexible licenses than GPL.

If you wish to use our code in other GPL programs, don't worry -- there is no
requirement that you provide the same exception in your GPL'd products.
