#+BEGIN_ABSTRACT
Creating Ethereum, Bitcoin and other accounts is complex and fraught with potential for loss of funds.

A BIP-39 seed recovery phrase helps, but a *single* lapse in security dooms the account (and all
derived accounts, in fact).  If someone finds your recovery phrase (or you lose it), the accounts
derived from that seed are /gone/.

The SLIP-39 standard allows you to split the seed between 1, 2, or more groups of several mnemonic
recovery phrases.  This is better, but creating such accounts is difficult; presently, only the
Trezor supports these, and they can only be created "manually".  Writing down 5 or more sets of 20
words is difficult, error-prone and time consuming.

The [[https://github.com/pjkundert/python-slip39.git][python-slip39]] project (and the [[https://slip39.com/app][SLIP-39 macOS/win32 App]]) exists to assist in the safe creation
and documentation of [[https://wolovim.medium.com/ethereum-201-hd-wallets-11d0c93c87][Ethereum HD Wallet]] seeds and derived accounts, with various SLIP-39 sharing
parameters.  It generates the new random wallet seed, and generates the expected standard Ethereum
account(s) (at [[https://medium.com/myetherwallet/hd-wallets-and-derivation-paths-explained-865a643c7bf2][derivation path]] =m/44'/60'/0'/0/0= by default) and Bitcoin accounts (at Bech32
derivation path =m/84'/0'/0'/0/0= by default), with wallet address and QR code (compatible with
Trezor derivations).  It produces the required SLIP-39 phrases, and outputs a single PDF containing
all the required printable cards to document the seed (and the specified derived accounts).

Output of BIP-38 or JSON encrypted Paper Wallets is supported, for import into standard software
cryptocurrency wallets.

On an secure (ideally air-gapped) computer, new seeds can safely be generated and the PDF saved to a
USB drive for printing (or directly printed without the file being saved to disk.).  Presently,
=slip39= can output example ETH, BTC, LTC, DOGE, BNB, CRO and XRP addresses derived from the seed,
to /illustrate/ what accounts are associated with the backed-up seed.  Recovery of the seed to a
[[https://shop.trezor.io/product/trezor-model-t?offer_id=15&aff_id=10388][Trezor "Model T"]] is simple, by entering the mnemonics right on the device.

We also support backup of existing insecure and unreliable BIP-39 Seed Phrases as SLIP-39 Mnemonic
cards, for existing BIP-39 hardware wallets like the [[https://shop.ledger.com/pages/ledger-nano-x?r=2cd1cb6ae51f][Ledger Nano]], etc.!  Recover from your existing
BIP-39 Seed Phrase Mnemonic, select "Using BIP-39" (and enter your BIP-39 passphrase), and generate
a set of SLIP-39 Mnemonic cards.  Later, use the SLIP-39 App to recover from your SLIP-39 Mnemonic
cards, click "Using BIP-39" to get your BIP-39 Mnemonic back, and use it (and your passphrase) to
recover your accounts to your Ledger (or other) hardware wallet.

* Security with Availability

  For both BIP-39 and SLIP-39, a 128- or 256-bit random "seed" is the source of an unlimited
  sequence of Ethereum and Bitcoin HD (Heirarchical Deterministic) derived Wallet accounts.  Anyone
  who can obtain this seed gains control of all Ethereum, Bitcoin (and other) accounts derived from
  it, so it must be securely stored.

  Losing this seed means that all of the HD Wallet accounts are permanently lost.  It must be /both/
  backed up securely, /and/ be readily accessible.

  Therefore, we must:

  - Ensure that nobody untrustworthy can recover the seed, but
  - Store the seed in many places, probably with several (some perhaps untrustworthy) people.

  How can we address these conflicting requirements?

** Shamir's Secret Sharing System (SSSS)

   [[https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0039.md][Satoshi Lab's (Trezor) SLIP-39]] uses SSSS to distribute the ability to recover the key to 1 or
   more "groups".  Collecting the mnemonics from the required number of groups allows recovery of
   the seed.

   For BIP-39, the number of groups is always 1, and the number of mnemonics required for that group
   is always 1.  This selection is both insecure (easy to accidentally disclose) and unreliable
   (easy to accidentally lose), but since most hardware wallets, *only* accept BIP-39 phrases, we
   also provide a way to /backup your BIP-39 phrase/ using SLIP-39!

   For SLIP-39, you specify a "group_threshold" of /how many/ of your groups must be successfully
   collected, to recover the seed; this seed is (conceptually) split between 1 or more groups
   (though not in reality -- each group's data /alone/ gives away /no information/ about the seed).

   For example, you might have First, Second, Fam and Frens groups, and decide that any 2 groups can
   be combined to recover the seed.  Each group has members with varying levels of trust and
   persistence, so have different number of Members, and differing numbers Required to recover that
   group's data:

   #+LATEX: {\scriptsize
   | Group  | Required |   | Members | Description                           |
   |--------+----------+---+---------+---------------------------------------|
   |        |      <r> |   | <l>     |                                       |
   | First  |        1 | / | 1       | Stored at home                        |
   | Second |        1 | / | 1       | Stored in office safe                 |
   | Fam    |        2 | / | 4       | Distributed to family members         |
   | Frens  |        3 | / | 6       | Distributed to friends and associates |
   #+LATEX: }

   The account owner might store their First and Second group data in their home and office safes.
   These are 1/1 groups (1 required, and only 1 member, so each of these are 1-card groups.)

   If the Seed needs to be recovered, collecting the First and Second cards from the home and
   office safe is sufficient to recover the Seed, and re-generate all of the HD Wallet accounts.

   Only 2 Fam group member's cards must be collected to recover the Fam group's data.  So, if the HD
   Wallet owner loses their home (and the one and only First group card) in a fire, they could get
   the one Second group card from the office safe, and also 2 cards from Fam group members, and
   recover the Seed and all of their wallets.

   If catastrophe strikes and the wallet owner dies, and the heirs don't have access to either the
   First (at home) or Second (at the office) cards, they can collect 2 Fam cards and 3 Frens cards
   (at the funeral, for example), completing the Fam and Frens groups' data, and recover the Seed,
   and all derived HD Wallet accounts.

   Since Frens are less likely to persist long term, we'll produce more (6) of these cards.
   Depending on how trustworthy the group is, adjust the Fren group's Required number higher (less
   trustworthy, more likely to know each-other, need to collect more to recover the group), or lower
   (more trustworthy, less likely to collude, need less to recover).

* SLIP-39 Account Creation, Recovery and Generation

  Generating a new SLIP-39 encoded Seed is easy, with results available as PDF and text.  Any number
  of derived HD wallet account addresses can be generated from this Seed, and the Seed (and all
  derived HD wallets, for all cryptocurrencies) can be recovered by collecting the desired groups of
  recover card phrases.  The default recovery groups are as described above.

** Creating New SLIP-39 Recoverable Seeds

   This is what the first page of the output SLIP-39 mnemonic cards PDF looks like:

   #+CAPTION: SLIP-39 Cards PDF (from =--secret ffff...=)
   #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 5in :options angle=0
   [[./images/slip39-cards.png]]

   Run the following to obtain a PDF file containing business cards with the default SLIP-39 groups
   for a new account Seed named "Personal"; insert a USB drive to collect the output, and run:

   #+LATEX: {\scriptsize
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   $ python3 -m pip install slip39        # Install slip39 in Python3
   $ cd /Volumes/USBDRIVE/                # Change current directory to USB
   $ python3 -m slip39 Personal           # Or just run "slip39 Personal"
   2021-12-25 11:10:38 slip39           ETH m/44'/60'/0'/0/0    : 0xb44A2011A99596671d5952CdC22816089f142FB3
   2021-12-25 11:10:38 slip39           Wrote SLIP-39-encoded wallet for 'Personal' to:\
     Personal-2021-12-22+15.45.36-0xb44A2011A99596671d5952CdC22816089f142FB3.pdf
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   #+LATEX: }
  
   The resultant PDF will be output into the designated file.
  
   This PDF file contains business card sized SLIP-39 Mnemonic cards, and will print on a single
   page of 8-1/2"x11" paper or card stock, and the cards can be cut out (=--card index=, =credit=,
   =half= (page), =third= and =quarter= are also available, as well as 4x6 =photo= and custom
   ="(<h>,<w>),<margin>"=).
  
   To get the data printed on the terminal as in this example (so you could write it down on cards
   instead), add a =-v= (to see it logged in a tabular format), or =--text= to have it printed to
   stdout in full lines (ie. for pipelining to other programs).

*** Paper Wallets

    The Trezor hardware wallet natively supports the input of SLIP-39 Mnemonics.  However, most
    software wallets do not (yet) support SLIP-39.  So, how do we load the Crypto wallets produced
    from our Seed into software wallets such as the Metamask plugin or the Brave browser, for
    example?

    The =slip39.gui= (and the macOS/win32 SLIP-39.App) support output of standard BIP-38 encrypted wallets
    for Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies such as BTC, LTC and DOGE.  It also outputs encrypted Ethereum
    JSON wallets for ETH.  Here is how to produce them (from a test secret Seed; exclude =--secret
    ffff...= for yours!):

    #+LATEX: {\scriptsize
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash :exports both :results output

    To recover your real SLIP-39 Seed Entropy and print wallets, use the SLIP-39 App's "Recover"
    Controls, or to do so on the command-line, use =slip39-recover=:

*** Supported Cryptocurrencies

    While the SLIP-39 Seed is not cryptocurrency-specific (any wallet for any cryptocurrency can be
    derived from it), each type of cryptocurrency has its own standard derivation path
    (eg. =m/44'/3'/0'/0/0= for DOGE), and its own address representation (eg. Bech32 at
    =m/84'/0'/0'/0/0= for BTC eg. =bc1qcupw7k8enymvvsa7w35j5hq4ergtvus3zk8a8s=.

    When you import your SLIP-39 Seed into a Trezor, you gain access to all derived HD
    cryptocurrency wallets supported directly by that hardware wallet, and *indirectly*, to any coin
    and/or blockchain network supported by any wallet software (eg. Metamask).
    
    | Crypto | Semantic | Path             | Address | Support |

**** ETH, BTC, LTC, DOGE

     These coins are natively supported both directly by the Trezor hardware wallet, and by most
     software wallets and "web3" platforms that interact with the Trezor, or can import the BIP-38
     or Ethereum JSON Paper Wallets produced by =python-slip39=.

**** BNB on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC): binance.com

     The Binance Smart Chain uses standard Ethereum addresses; support for the BSC is added directly
     to the wallet software; here are the instructions for adding BSC support for the Trezor
     hardware wallet, [[https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/wallet/trezor.html][using the Metamask software wallet]].  In =python-slip39=, BNB is simply an alias for
     ETH, since the wallet addresses and Ethereum JSON Paper Wallets are identical.

**** CRO on Cronos: crypto.com

     The Cronos chain (formerly known as the Crypto.org chain). It is the native chain of the
     [[https://crypto.com][crypto.com CRO]]  coin.

     Cronos also uses Ethereum addresses on the =m/44'/60'/0'/0/0= derivation path, but represents
     them as Bech32 addresses with a "crc" prefix, eg. =crc19a6r74dvfxjyvjzf3pg9y3y5rhk6rds2c9265n=.
     As with BNB, the wallet must support the Cronos blockchain; instructions exist for adding CRO
     support for the Trezor hardware wallet, [[https://cronos.org/docs/getting-started/metamask.html][using the Metamask software wallet]].

** The macOS/win32 =SLIP-39.app= GUI App

   If you prefer a graphical user-interface, try the macOS/win32 SLIP-39.App.  You can run it directly if
   you install Python 3.9+ from [[https://python.org/downloads][python.org/downloads]] or using homebrew =brew install
   python-tk@3.10=.  Then, start the GUI in a variety of ways:

   #+LATEX: {\scriptsize
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   slip39-gui
   python3 -m slip39.gui
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   #+LATEX: }

   Alternatively, download and install the macOS/win32 GUI App .zip, .pkg or .dmg installer from
   [[https://github.com/pjkundert/python-slip39/releases/latest][github.com/pjkundert/python-slip-39/releases]].

** The Python =slip39= CLI

   From the command line, you can create SLIP-39 Seed Mnemonic card PDFs.

  =slip39-recovery= until the secret is recovered (invalid/duplicate mnemonics will be ignored):

    : original BIP-39 mnemonic phrase.
    : 
    : 2) The original BIP-39 12- or 24-word, 128- to 256-bit Seed Entropy can be recovered by supplying
    : --entropy.  This modifies the BIP-39 recovery to return the original BIP-39 Mnemonic Entropy, before
    : decryption and seed generation.  It has no effect for SLIP-39 recovery.

*** Pipelining =slip39.recovery | slip39 --secret -=

   The tools can be used in a pipeline to avoid printing the secret.  Here we generate some
   mnemonics, sorting them in reverse order so we need more than just the first couple to recover.
   Observe the Ethereum wallet address generated.

   Then, we recover the master secret seed in hex with =slip39-recovery=, and finally send it to
   =slip39 --secret -= to re-generate the same wallet as we originally created.

*** =slip39.recover=

    Takes a number of SLIP-39 mnemonics, and if sufficient =group_threshold= groups' mnemonics are
    present (and the options =passphrase= is supplied), the =master_secret= is recovered.  This can
    be used with =slip39.accounts= to directly obtain any =Account= data.

    Note that the SLIP-39 passphrase is *not* checked; entering a different passphrase for the same
    set of mnemonics will recover a *different* wallet!  This is by design; it allows the holder of
    the SLIP-39 mnemonic phrases to recover a "decoy" wallet by supplying a specific passphrase,
    while protecting the "primary" wallet.

    Therefore, it is *essential* to remember any non-default (non-empty) passphrase used, separately and
    securely.  Take great care in deciding if you wish to use a passphrase with your SLIP-39 wallet!

* Conversion from BIP-39 to SLIP-39

  If we already have a BIP-39 wallet, it would certainly be nice to be able to create nice, safe
  SLIP-39 mnemonics for it, and discard the unsafe BIP-39 mnemonics we have lying around, just
  waiting to be accidentally discovered and the account compromised!

  Fortunately, *we can* do this!  It takes a bit of practice to become comfortable with the process,
  but once you do -- you can confidently discard your original insecure and unreliable BIP-39
  Mnemonic backups.

** BIP-39 vs. SLIP-39 Incompatibility

   Unfortunately, it is *not possible* to cleanly convert a BIP-39 /generated/ wallet Seed into a
   SLIP-39 wallet.  Both BIP-39 and SLIP-39 preserve the original 128- to 256-bit Seed Entropy
   (random) bits, but these bits are used *very differently* -- and incompatibly -- to generate the
   resultant wallet Seed.

   In native SLIP-39, the original, recovered Seed Entropy (128- or 256-bits) is used directly by
   the BIP-44 wallet derivation.  In BIP-39, the Seed entropy is not directly used /at all/!  It is
   only *indirectly* used; the BIP-39 Seed Phrase (which contains the exact, original entropy) is
   used, as normalized text, as input to a hashing function, along with some other fixed text, to
   produce a 512-bit Seed, which is then fed into the BIP-44 wallet derivation process.

   The least desirable method is to preserve the 512-bit *output* of the BIP-39 mnemonic phrase as a
   set of 512-bit (59-word) SLIP-39 Mnemonics.  But first, lets review how BIP-39 works.

*** BIP-39 Entropy to Mnemonic

    BIP-39 uses a single set of 12, 15, 18, 21 or 24 BIP-39 words to carefully preserve a specific
    128 to 256 bits of initial Seed Entropy.  Here's a 128-bit (12-word) example using some fixed
    "entropy" =0xFFFF..FFFF=.  You'll note that, from the BIP-39 Mnemonic, we can either recover the
    original 128-bit Seed Entropy, *or* we can generate the resultant 512-bit Seed w/ the correct
    passphrase:

    #+LATEX: {\scriptsize
    #+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :results output raw drawer
    from mnemonic import Mnemonic
    bip39_english       = Mnemonic("english")
    entropy             = b'\xFF' * 16
    entropy_hex		= codecs.encode( entropy, 'hex_codec' ).decode( 'ascii' )
    entropy_mnemonic    = bip39_english.to_mnemonic( entropy )

    recovered		= slip39.recover_bip39( entropy_mnemonic, as_entropy=True )
    recovered_hex	= codecs.encode( recovered, 'hex_codec' ).decode( 'ascii' )

    recovered_seed	= slip39.recover_bip39( entropy_mnemonic, passphrase=passphrase )
    recovered_seed_hex	= codecs.encode( recovered_seed, 'hex_codec' ).decode( 'ascii' )
    
    print( tabulate( [
        [ "Original Entropy", entropy_hex ],
        [ "BIP-39 Mnemonic", entropy_mnemonic ],
        [ "Recovered Entropy", recovered_hex ],
        [ "Recovered Seed", f"{recovered_seed_hex:.50}..." ],
    ], tablefmt='orgtbl'))
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    :results:

    #+LATEX: }

    Each word is one of a corpus of 2048 words; therefore, each word encodes 11 bits (2048 = 2**11)
    of entropy.  So, we provided 128 bits, but 12*11 = 132.  So where does the extra 4 bits of data
    come from?

    It comes from the first few bits of a SHA256 hash of the entropy, which is added to the end of
    the supplied 128 bits, to reach the required 132 bits: 132 / 11 = 12 words.

    This last 4 bits (up to 8 bits, for a 256-bit 24-word BIP-39) is checked, when validating the
    BIP-39 mnemonic.  Therefore, making up a random BIP-39 mnemonic will succeed only 1 / 16 times on
    average, due to an incorrect checksum 4-bit (16 = 2**4) .  Lets check:

    #+LATEX: {\scriptsize
    #+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :results output raw drawer
    def random_words( n, count=100 ):
        for _ in range( count ):
            yield ' '.join( random.choice( bip39_english.wordlist ) for _ in range( n ))

    successes           = sum(
        bip39_english.check( m )
        for i,m in enumerate( random_words( 12, 10000 ))) / 100

    print( tabulate( [
      [ "Valid random 12-word mnemonics:", f"{successes}%" ],
      [ "Or, about: ", f"1 / {100/successes:.3}" ],
    ], tablefmt='orgtbl' ))
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    :results:
    | Valid random 12-word mnemonics: |    6.26% |
    | Or, about:                      | 1 / 16.0 |
    :end:
    #+LATEX: }

    Sure enough, about 1/16 random 12-word phrases are valid BIP-39 mnemonics.  OK, we've got the
    contents of the BIP-39 phrase dialed in.  How is it used to generate accounts?

*** BIP-39 Mnemonic to Seed

    Unfortunately, BIP-39 does *not* use the carefully preserved 128-bit entropy to generate the wallet!
    Nope, it is stretched to a 512-bit seed using PBKDF2 HMAC SHA512.  The normalized *text* (/not
    the Entropy bytes/) of the 12-word mnemonic is then used (with a salt of "mnemonic" plus an
    optional passphrase, "" by default), to obtain the 512-bit seed:

    #+LATEX: {\scriptsize
    #+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :results output raw drawer
    seed                = bip39_english.to_seed( entropy_mnemonic )
    seed_hex            = codecs.encode( seed, 'hex_codec' ).decode( 'ascii' )
    print( tabulate( [
     [ f"{len(seed)*8}-bit seed:", f"{seed_hex:.50}..." ]
    ], tablefmt='orgtbl' ))
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    :results:
    | 512-bit seed: | b6a6d8921942dd9806607ebc2750416b289adea669198769f2... |
    :end:
    #+LATEX: }

*** BIP-39 Seed to Address

    Finally, this 512-bit seed is used to derive HD wallet(s).  The HD Wallet key derivation process
    consumes whatever seed entropy is provided (512 bits in the case of BIP-39), and uses HMAC SHA512
    with a prefix of b"Bitcoin seed" to stretch the supplied seed entropy to 64 bytes (512 bits).
    Then, the HD Wallet *path* segments are iterated through, permuting the first 32 bytes of this
    material as the key with the second 32 bytes of material as the chain node, until finally the
    32-byte (256-bit) Ethereum account private key is produced.  We then use this private key to
    compute the rest of the Ethereum account details, such as its public address.

    #+LATEX: {\scriptsize
    #+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :results output raw drawer
    path                = "m/44'/60'/0'/0/0"
    bip39_eth_hd        = slip39.account( seed, 'ETH', path )
    print( tabulate( [
     [ f"{len(bip39_eth_hd.key)*4}-bit derived key path:", f"{path}" ],
     [ "Produces private key: ", f"{bip39_eth_hd.key}" ],
     [ "Yields Ethereum address:", f"{bip39_eth_hd.address}" ],
    ], tablefmt='orgtbl' ))
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    :results:
    | 256-bit derived key path: | m/44'/60'/0'/0/0                                                 |
    | Produces private key:     | 7af65ba4dd53f23495dcb04995e96f47c243217fc279f10795871b725cd009ae |
    | Yields Ethereum address:  | 0xfc2077CA7F403cBECA41B1B0F62D91B5EA631B5E                       |
    :end:
    #+LATEX: }

    Thus, we see that while the 12-word BIP-39 mnemonic careful preserves the original 128-bit
    entropy, this data is not directly used to derive the wallet private key and address.  Also,
    since an irreversible hash is used to derive the Seed from the Mnemonic, we can't reverse the
    process on the seed to arrive back at the BIP-39 mnemonic phrase.

*** SLIP-39 Entropy to Mnemonic

    Just like BIP-39 carefully preserves the original 128-bit Seed Entropy bytes in a single 12-word
    mnemonic phrase, SLIP-39 preserves the original 128- or 256-bit Seed Entropy in a /set/ of 20-
    or 33-word Mnemonic phrases.

    #+LATEX: {\scriptsize
    #+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :results output raw drawer
    name,thrs,grps,acct,ub39 = slip39.create(
        "Test", 2, { "Mine": (1,1), "Fam": (2,3) }, entropy )
    print( tabulate( [
        [ f"{g_name}({g_of}/{len(g_mnems)}) #{g_n+1}:" if l_n == 0 else "" ] + words
        for g_name,(g_of,g_mnems) in grps.items()
        for g_n,mnem in enumerate( g_mnems )
        for l_n,(line,words) in enumerate(slip39.organize_mnemonic(
                mnem, rows=7, cols=3, label=f"{g_name}({g_of}/{len(g_mnems)}) #{g_n+1}:" ))

    Since there is some randomness used in the SLIP-39 mnemonics generation process, we would get a

*** SLIP-39 Mnemonic to Seed

    Lets prove that we can actually recover the *original* Seed Entropy from the SLIP-39 recovery
    Mnemonics; in this case, we've specified a SLIP-39 group_threshold of 2 groups, so we'll use 1
    Mnemonic from Mine, and 2 from the Fam group:

    #+LATEX: {\scriptsize
    #+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :results output raw drawer
    _,mnem_mine         = grps['Mine']
    _,mnem_fam          = grps['Fam']
    recseed             = slip39.recover( mnem_mine + mnem_fam[:2] )
    recseed_hex         = codecs.encode( recseed, 'hex_codec' ).decode( 'ascii' )
    print( tabulate( [
        [ f"{len(recseed)*8}-bit Seed:", f"{recseed_hex}" ]
    ], tablefmt='orgtbl' ))
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    :results:
    | 128-bit Seed: | ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff |
    :end:
    #+LATEX: }

*** SLIP-39 Seed to Address

    And we'll use the same style of code as for the BIP-39 example above, to derive the Ethereum
    address *directly* from this recovered 128-bit seed:

    #+LATEX: {\scriptsize
    #+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :results output raw drawer
    slip39_eth_hd       = slip39.account( recseed, 'ETH', path )
    print( tabulate( [
        [ f"{len(slip39_eth_hd.key)*4}-bit derived key path:", f"{path}" ],
        [ "Produces private key: ", f"{slip39_eth_hd.key}" ],
        [ "Yields Ethereum address:", f"{slip39_eth_hd.address}" ],
    ], tablefmt='orgtbl' ))
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    :results:
    | 256-bit derived key path: | m/44'/60'/0'/0/0                                                 |
    | Produces private key:     | 6a2ec39aab88ec0937b79c8af6aaf2fd3c909e9a56c3ddd32ab5354a06a21a2b |
    | Yields Ethereum address:  | 0x824b174803e688dE39aF5B3D7Cd39bE6515A19a1                       |
    :end:
    #+LATEX: }

    And we see that we obtain the same Ethereum address =0x824b..1a2b= as we originally got from
    =slip39.create= above.  However, this is *not the same* Ethereum wallet address obtained from
    BIP-39 with exactly the same =0xFFFF...FF= Seed Entropy, which was =0xfc20..1B5E=!

    This is due to the fact that BIP-39 does not use the recovered Seed Entropy to produce the seed
    like SLIP-39 does, but applies additional one-way hashing of the Mnemonic to produce a 512-bit
    Seed.

** BIP-39 vs SLIP-39 Key Derivation Summary

   At no time in BIP-39 account derivation is the original 128-bit Seed Entropy used (directly) in
   the derivation of the wallet key.  This differs from SLIP-39, which directly uses the 128-bit
   Seed Entropy recovered from the SLIP-39 Shamir's Secret Sharing System recovery process to
   generate each HD Wallet account's private key.

   Furthermore, there is no point in the BIP-39 Seed Entropy to account generation where we *could*
   introduce a known 128-bit seed and produce a known Ethereum wallet from it, other than as the
   very beginning.

   Therefore, our BIP-39 Backup via SLIP-39 strategy must focus on backing up the original 128- to
   256-bit Seed Entropy.

** BIP-39 Backup via SLIP-39

   Here are the two available methods for backing up insecure and unreliable BIP-39 Mnemonic
   phrases, using SLIP-39.

   The first "Emergency Recovery" method allows you to recover your BIP-39 generated wallets
   *without the passphrase*, but does not support recovery using hardware wallets; you must output
   "Paper Wallets" and use them to recover the Cryptocurrency funds.

   The second "Best Recovery: Using BIP-39" allows us to recover the accounts to /any/ standard
   BIP-39 hardware wallet!  However, the SLIP-39 Mnemonics are *not* compatible with standard
   SLIP-39 wallets like the Trezor "Model T" -- you have to use the recovered BIP-39 Mnemonic phrase
   to recover the hardware wallet.
   
*** Emergency Recovery: Using Recovered Paper Wallets

    There is one approach which can preserve an original BIP-39 /generated/ wallet addresses, using
    SLIP-39 mnemonics.

    It is clumsy, as it preserves the BIP-39 *output* 512-bit stretched seed, and the resultant
    59-word SLIP-39 mnemonics cannot be used (at present) with the Trezor hardware wallet.  They
    can, however, be used to recover the HD wallet private keys without access to the original
    BIP-39 Mnemonic phrase /or passphrase/ -- you could generate and distribute a set of more secure
    SLIP-39 Mnemonic phrases, instead of trying to secure the original BIP-39 mnemonic + passphrase
    -- without abandoning your existing BIP-39 wallets.

    We'll use =slip39.recovery --bip39 ...= to recover the 512-bit stretched seed from BIP-39:

    This =0xfc20..1B5E= address is the same Ethereum address as is recovered on a Trezor using this
    BIP-39 mnemonic phrase.  Thus, we can generate "Paper Wallets" for the desired Cryptocurrency
    accounts, and recover the funds.

    So, this does the job:
    - Uses our original BIP-39 Mnemonic
    - Does not require remembering the BIP-39 passphrase
    - Preserves all of the original wallets

    But:
    - The 59-word SLIP-39 Mnemonics cannot (yet) be imported into the Trezor "Model T"
    - The original BIP-39 Mnemonic phrase cannot be recovered, for any hardware wallet
    - Must use the SLIP-39 App to generate "Paper Wallets", to recover the funds

    So, this is a good "emergency backup" solution; you or your heirs would be able to recover the
    funds with a very high level of security and reliability.

*** Best Recovery: Using Recovered BIP-39 Mnemonic Phrase

    The best solution is to use SLIP-39 to back up the original BIP-39 Seed /Entropy/ (/not/ the
    generated Seed), and then later recover that Seed Entropy and re-generate the BIP-39 Mnemonic
    phrase.  You will continue to need to remember and use your original BIP-39 passphrase:

    #+BEGIN_SRC mermaid :file images/BIP-39-backup-entropy.png
    sequenceDiagram
    Participant BIP as BIP-39 Mnemonic
    Participant SLIP as SLIP-39 Mnemonics

    BIP_REC-->>HW: Recover w/ BIP-39 Mnemonic + passphrase
    #+END_SRC
    #+RESULTS:
    [[file:images/BIP-39-backup-entropy.png]]

    First, observe that we can recover the 128-bit Seed Entropy from the BIP-39 Mnemonic phrase (not
    the 512-bit generated Seed):
    #+LATEX: {\scriptsize3
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash :exports both :results output
    ( python3 -m slip39.recovery --bip39 --entropy -v \
        --mnemonic "zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo wrong" 
    ) 2>&1
    #+END_SRC
    #+RESULTS:

    : ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
    #+LATEX: }

    Now we generate SLIP-39 Mnemonics to recover the 128-bit Seed Entropy.  Note that these are
    20-word Mnemonics.  However, these are *NOT* the wallets we expected!  These are the well-known
    native SLIP-39 wallets from the =0xFFFF...FF= Seed Entropy; not the well-known native BIP-39
    wallets from that Seed Entropy, which generate the Ethereum wallet address =0xfc20..1B5E=!  Why
    not?

    And, there we have it -- we've recovered exactly the same Ethereum and Bitcoin wallets as would
    a native BIP-39 hardware wallet like a Ledger Nano.

**** Using SLIP-39 App "Backup" Controls

     In the SLIP-39 App, the default Controls presented are to "Backup" a BIP-39 recovery phrase.

     In "Seed Source", enter your existing BIP-39 recovery phrase.  In "Seed Secret", make sure
     "Using BIP-39" is selected, and enter your BIP-39 passphrase.  This allows us to display the
     proper wallet addresses -- we do *not* store your password, or save it as part of the SLIP-39
     cards!  You will need to remember and use your passphrase whenever you use your BIP-39 phrase
     to initialize a hardware wallet.

     Check that the Recovery needs ... Mnemonic Card Groups are correct for your application, and
     hit Save!

     Later, use the "Recover" Controls to get your BIP-39 recovery phrase back, from your SLIP-39
     cards, whenever you need it.

     Practice this a few times (using the "zoo zoo ... wrong" 12-word or "zoo zoo ... vote" 24-word
     phrase) until you're confident.  Then, back up your real BIP-39 recovery phrase.

     Once you're convinced you can securely and reliably recover your BIP-39 phrase any time you
     need it, we recommend that you destroy your original BIP-39 recovery phrase backup(s).  They
     are dangerous and unreliable, and only serve to make your Cryptocurrency accounts *less*
     secure!

* Building & Installing

  The =python-slip39= project is tested under both homebrew:
  : $ brew install python-tk@3.9
  and using [[https://www.python.org/downloads/][the official python.org/downloads installer]].

  Either of these methods will get you a =python3= executable running version 3.9+, usable for
  running the =slip39= module, and the =slip39.gui= GUI.

** The =slip39= Module

   To build the wheel and install =slip39= manually:
   : $ git clone git@github.com:pjkundert/python-slip39.git
   : $ make -C python-slip39 install

   To install from Pypi, including the optional requirements to run the PySimpleGUI/tkinter GUI,
   support serial I/O, and to support creating encrypted BIP-38 and Ethereum JSON Paper Wallets:
   : $ python3 -m pip install slip39[gui,paper,serial]

** The =slip39= GUI

   To install from Pypi, including the optional requirements to run the PySimpleGUI/tkinter GUI:
   : $ python3 -m pip install slip39[gui]

   Then, there are several ways to run the GUI:
   : $ python3 -m slip39.gui     # Execute the python slip39.gui module main method
   : $ slip39-gui                # Run the main function provided by the slip39.gui module
   
*** The macOS/win32 =SLIP-39.app= GUI

    You can build the native macOS and win32 =SLIP-39.app= App.

    This requires the official [[https://python.org/downloads][python.org/downloads]] installer; the homebrew python-tk@3.9 will not
    work for building the native app using either =PyInstaller=. (The =py2app= approach doesn't work
    in either version of Python).

    : $ git clone git@github.com:pjkundert/python-slip39.git
    : $ make -C python-slip39 app

*** The Windows 10 =SLIP-39= GUI

    Install Python from https://python.org/downloads, and the [[https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools][Microsoft C++ Build Tools]] via the
    Visual Studio Installer (required for installing some =slip39= package dependencies).

    To run the GUI, just install =slip39= package from Pypi using pip, including the =gui= and
    =wallet= options.  Building the Windows =SLIP-39= executable GUI application requires the =dev=
    option.
    : PS C:\Users\IEUser> pip install slip39[gui,wallet,dev]

    To work with the [[https://github.com/pjkundert/python-slip39.git][python-slip39 Git repo on Github]], you'll also need to install [[https://git-scm.com/download/win][Git from
    git-scm.com]]. Once installed, run "Git bash", and
    : $ ssh-keygen.exe -t ed25519
    to create an =id_ed25519.pub= SSH identity, and import it into your Git Settings SSH keys.  Then,
    : $ mkdir src
    : $ cd src
    : $ git clone git@github.com:pjkundert/python-slip39.git

**** Code Signing    

     The MMC (Microsoft Management Console) is used to store your code-signing certificates.  
     See [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19879812/signing-exe-with-cer-file-what-is-my-certificates-name-that-signtool-exe-is][stackoverflow.com]] for how to enable its Certificate management.

* Dependencies

  Internally, python-slip39 project uses Trezor's [[https://gihub.com/trezor/python-shamir-mnemonic.git][python-shamir-mnemonic]] to encode the seed data to
  SLIP-39 phrases, [[https://github.com/meherett/python-hdwallet.git][python-hdwallet]] to convert seeds to ETH, BTC, LTC and DOGE wallets, and the
  Ethereum project's [[https://github.com/ethereum/eth-account][eth-account]] to produce encrypted JSON wallets for specified Ethereum accounts.

** The =python-shamir-mnemonic= API

   To use it directly, obtain , and install it, or run =python3 -m pip install shamir-mnemonic=.
