#+BEGIN_ABSTRACT
Creating Ethereum, Bitcoin and other accounts is complex and fraught with potential for loss of funds.

A BIP-39 seed recovery phrase helps, but a *single* lapse in security dooms the account (and all
derived accounts, in fact).  If someone finds your recovery phrase (or you lose it), the accounts
derived from that seed are /gone/.

The SLIP-39 standard allows you to split the seed between 1, 2, or more groups of several mnemonic
recovery phrases.  This is better, but creating such accounts is difficult; presently, only the
Trezor supports these, and they can only be created "manually".  Writing down 5 or more sets of 20
words is difficult, error-prone and time consuming.

The [[https://github.com/pjkundert/python-slip39.git][python-slip39]] project exists to assist in the safe creation and documentation of [[https://wolovim.medium.com/ethereum-201-hd-wallets-11d0c93c87][Ethereum HD
Wallet]] seeds and derived accounts, with various SLIP-39 sharing parameters.  It generates the new
random wallet seed, and generates the expected standard Ethereum account(s) (at [[https://medium.com/myetherwallet/hd-wallets-and-derivation-paths-explained-865a643c7bf2][derivation path]]
=m/44'/60'/0'/0/0= by default) and Bitcoin accounts (at derivation path =m/84'/0'/0'/0/0= by
default), with wallet address and QR code (compatible with Trezor derivations).  It produces the
required SLIP-39 phrases, and outputs a single PDF containing all the required printable cards to
document the seed (and the specified derived accounts).

Output of BIP-38 or JSON encrypted paper wallets is supported, to support software cryptocurrency
wallets.

On an secure (ideally air-gapped) computer, new seeds can safely be generated and the PDF saved to a
USB drive for printing (or directly printed without the file being saved to disk.).  Presently,
=slip39= can output example ETH, BTC, LTC and DOGE addresses derived from the seed, to illustrate
what accounts are associated with the backed-up seed.  Recovery of the seed to a Trezor is simple,
by entering the mnemonics right on the device.

* Security with Availability

  For both BIP-39 and SLIP-39, a 128-bit random "seed" is the source of an unlimited sequence of
  Ethereum HD Wallet accounts.  Anyone who can obtain this seed gains control of all Ethereum,
  Bitcoin (and other) accounts derived from it, so it must be securely stored.

  Losing this seed means that all of the HD Wallet accounts are permanently lost.  Therefore, it
  must be backed up reliably, and be readily accessible.

  Therefore, we must:

  - Ensure that nobody untrustworthy can recover the seed, but
  - Store the seed in many places with several (some perhaps untrustworthy) people.

  How can we address these conflicting requirements?

** Shamir's Secret Sharing System (SSSS)

   [[https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0039.md][Satoshi Lab's (Trezor) SLIP-39]] uses SSSS to distribute the ability to recover the key to 1 or
   more "groups".  Collecting the mnemonics from the required number of groups allows recovery of
   the seed.  For BIP-39, the number of groups is always 1, and the number of mnemonics required for
   that group is always 1.

   For SLIP-39, a "group_threshold" of how many groups must bet successfully collected to recover
   the key.  Then key is (conceptually) split between 1 or more groups (not really; each group's
   data alone gives away no information about the key).

   For example, you might have First, Second, Fam and Frens groups, and decide that any 2 groups can
   be combined to recover the key.  Each group has members with varying levels of trust and
   persistence, so have different number of Members, and differing numbers Required to recover that
   group's data:

   #+LATEX: {\scriptsize
   | Group  | Required |   | Members | Description                           |
   |--------+----------+---+---------+---------------------------------------|
   |        |      <r> |   | <l>     |                                       |
   | First  |        1 | / | 1       | Stored at home                        |
   | Second |        1 | / | 1       | Stored in office safe                 |
   | Fam    |        2 | / | 4       | Distributed to family members         |
   | Frens  |        3 | / | 6       | Distributed to friends and associates |
   #+LATEX: }

   The account owner might store their First and Second group data in their home and office safes.
   These are 1/1 groups (1 required, and only 1 member, so each of these are3 1-card groups.)

   If the account needs to be recovered, collecting the First and Second cards from the home and
   office safe is sufficient to recover the seed, and re-generate the HD Wallet accounts.

   Only 2 Fam member's cards must be collected to recover the Fam group's data.  So, if the HD
   Wallet owner loses their home and First group card in a fire, they could get the Second group
   card from the office safe, and 2 cards from Fam group members, and recover the wallet.

   If catastrophe strikes and the owner dies, and the heirs don't have access to either the First
   (at home) or Second (at the office), they can collect 2 Fam cards and 3 Frens cards (at the
   funeral, for example), completing the Fam and Frens groups' data, and recover the HD Wallet
   account.  Since Frens are less likely to persist long term (and are also less likely to know
   each-other), we'll require a lower proportion of them to be collected.

* SLIP-39 Account Creation, Recovery and Address Generation

  Generating a new SLIP-39 encoded seed is easy, with results available as PDF and text.  Any number
  of accounts can be generated from this seed, and it can be recovered by collecting the desired
  groups of recover card phrases.  The default recovery groups are as described above.

** Creating New SLIP-39 Recoverable Seeds

   This is what the first page of the output SLIP-39 mnemonic cards PDF looks like:

   #+CAPTION: SLIP-39 Cards PDF (from =--secret ffff...=)
   #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 6in :options angle=0
   [[./images/slip39-cards.png]]

   Run the following to obtain a PDF file containing index cards with the default SLIP-39 groups for
   a new account seed named "Personal"; insert a USB drive to collect the output, and run:

   #+LATEX: {\scriptsize
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   $ python3 -m pip install slip39        # Install slip39 in Python3
   $ cd /Volumes/USBDRIVE/                # Change current directory to USB
   $ python3 -m slip39 Personal           # Or just run "slip39 Personal"
   2021-12-25 11:10:38 slip39           ETH m/44'/60'/0'/0/0    : 0xb44A2011A99596671d5952CdC22816089f142FB3
   2021-12-25 11:10:38 slip39           Wrote SLIP-39-encoded wallet for 'Personal' to:\
     Personal-2021-12-22+15.45.36-0xb44A2011A99596671d5952CdC22816089f142FB3.pdf
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   #+LATEX: }
  
   The resultant PDF will be output into the designated file.
  
   This PDF file can be printed on 3x5 index cards, or on regular paper or card stock and the cards
   can be cut out (=--card credit= , =business=, =half= (page) and =third= (page) are also
   available, as well as custom ="(<h>,<w>),<margin>"=).
  
   To get the data printed on the terminal as in this example (so you could write it down on cards
   instead), add a =-v= (to see it logged in a tabular format), or =--text= to have it printed to
   stdout in full lines (ie. for pipelining to other programs).

*** Paper Wallets

    The Trezor hardware wallet natively supports the input of SLIP-39 Mnemonics.  However, most
    software wallets do not (yet) support SLIP-39.  So, how do we load the Crypto wallets produced
    from our Seed into software wallets such as the Metamask plugin or the Brave browser, for
    example?

    The =slip39.gui= (and the macOS SLIP-39.App) support output of standard BIP-38 encrypted wallets
    for Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies such as BTC, LTC and DOGE.  It also outputs encrypted Ethereum
    JSON wallets for ETH.  Here is how to produce them (from a test secret Seed; exclude =--secret
    ffff...= for yours!):

    #+LATEX: {\scriptsize
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ slip39 -c ETH -c BTC -c DOGE -c LTC --secret ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff \
        --wallet password --wallet-hint 'bad:pass...'
    #+END_EXAMPLE
    #+LATEX: }

    And what they look like:
    
    #+CAPTION: Paper Wallets (from =--secret ffff...=)
    #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 6in :options angle=0
   [[./images/slip39-wallets.png]]

** The macOS =SLIP-39.app= GUI App

   If you prefer a graphical user-interface, try the macOS SLIP-39.App.  You can run it directly if
   you install Python 3.9+ from [[https://python.org/downloads][python.org/downloads]] or using homebrew =brew install
   python-tk@3.10=.  Then, start the GUI in a variety of ways:

   #+LATEX: {\scriptsize
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   slip39-gui
   python3 -m slip39.gui
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   #+LATEX: }

   Alternatively, download and install the macOS GUI App .zip, .pkg or .dmg installer from
   [[https://github.com/pjkundert/python-slip39/releases/latest][github.com/pjkundert/python-slip-39/releases]].

** The Python =slip39= CLI

   From the command line, you can create SLIP-39 seed Mnemonic card PDFs.

** Recovery & Re-Creation

  Later, if you need to recover the wallet seed, keep entering SLIP-39 mnemonics into
  =slip39-recovery= until the secret is recovered (invalid/duplicate mnemonics will be ignored):

  #+LATEX: {\scriptsize
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ python3 -m slip39.recovery   # (or just "slip39-recovery")
  Enter 1st SLIP-39 mnemonic: ab c
  Enter 2nd SLIP-39 mnemonic: veteran guilt acrobat romp burden campus purple webcam uncover ...
  Enter 3rd SLIP-39 mnemonic: veteran guilt acrobat romp burden campus purple webcam uncover ...
  Enter 4th SLIP-39 mnemonic: veteran guilt beard romp dragon island merit burden aluminum worthy ...

  383597fd63547e7c9525575decd413f7
  #+END_EXAMPLE
  #+LATEX: }

  Finally, re-create the wallet seed, perhaps including an encrypted JSON wallet file for import of
  some accounts into a software wallet:

  #+LATEX: {\scriptsize
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash :exports both :results output
  slip39 --secret 383597fd63547e7c9525575decd413f7 --json password 2>&1

*** Pipelining =slip39.recovery | slip39 --secret -=

   The tools can be used in a pipeline to avoid printing the secret.  Here we generate some
   mnemonics, sorting them in reverse order so we need more than just the first couple to recover.
   Observe the Ethereum wallet address generated.

   Then, we recover the master secret seed in hex with =slip39-recovery=, and finally send it to
   =slip39 --secret -= to re-generate the same wallet as we originally created.

** Generation of Addresses

   For systems that require a stream of groups of wallet Addresses (eg. for preparing invoices for
   clients, with a choice of cryptocurrency payment options), =slip-generator= can produce a stream
   of groups of addresses.

    : random nonce generated at program start time.  This nonce is incremented for each record output.
    : 
    : Since the receiver requires the nonce to decrypt, and we do not want to separately transmit the
    : nonce and supply it to the receiver, the first record emitted when --encrypt is specified is the
    : random nonce, encrypted with the password, itself with a known nonce of all 0 bytes.  The plaintext
    : data is random, while the nonce is not, but since this construction is only used once, it should be
    : satisfactory.  This first nonce record is transmitted with an enumeration prefix of "nonce".

*** Producing Addresses

    Addresses can be produced in plaintext or encrypted, and output to stdout or to a serial port.

    To produce accounts from a BIP-39 or SLIP-39 seed, recover it using slip39-recovery.

    Here's an example of recovering a test BIP-39 seed; note that it yields the well-known ETH
    =0xfc20...1B5E= and BTC =bc1qk0...gnn2= accounts associated with this test Mnemonic:

*** =slip39.recover=

    Takes a number of SLIP-39 mnemonics, and if sufficient =group_threshold= groups' mnemonics are
    present (and the options =passphrase= is supplied), the =master_secret= is recovered.  This can
    be used with =slip39.accounts= to directly obtain any =Account= data.

    Note that the passphrase is *not* checked; entering a different passphrase for the same set of
    mnemonics will recover a *different* wallet!  This is by design; it allows the holder of the
    SLIP-39 mnemonic phrases to recover a "decoy" wallet by supplying a specific passphrase, while
    protecting the "primary" wallet.

    Therefore, it is *essential* to remember any non-default (empty) passphrase used, separately and
    securely.  Take great care in deciding if you wish to use a passphrase with your SLIP-39 wallet!

* Conversion from BIP-39 to SLIP-39

  If we already have a BIP-39 wallet, it would certainly be nice to be able to create nice, safe
  SLIP-39 mnemonics for it, and discard the unsafe BIP-39 mnemonics we have lying around, just
  waiting to be accidentally discovered and the account compromised!

** BIP-39 vs. SLIP-39 Incompatibility

   Unfortunately, it is *not possible* to cleanly convert a BIP-39 derived wallet into a SLIP-39
   wallet.  Both of these techniques preserve "entropy" (random) bits, but these bits are used
   *differently* -- and incompatibly -- to derive the resultant Ethereum wallets.

   The best we can do is to preserve the 512-bit *output* of the BIP-39 mnemonic phrase as a set of
   512-bit SLIP-39 mnemonics.

*** BIP-39 Entropy to Mnemonic

    BIP-39 uses a single set of 12, 15, 18, 21 or 24 BIP-39 words to carefully preserve a specific
    128 to 256 bits of initial entropy.  Here's a 128-bit (12-word) example using some fixed
    "entropy" =0xFFFF..FFFF=:

    #+LATEX: {\scriptsize
    #+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :results raw drawer
    from mnemonic import Mnemonic
    bip39_english       = Mnemonic("english")
    entropy             = b'\xFF' * 16
    entropy_mnemonic    = bip39_english.to_mnemonic( entropy )
    [
     [ entropy_mnemonic ]
    ]
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    :results:
    # Out[9]:
    | 0                                                 |
    |---------------------------------------------------|
    | zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo wrong |
    :end:

    #+LATEX: }

    Each word is one of a corpus of 2048 words; therefore, each word encodes 11 bits (2048 == 2**11)
    of entropy.  So, we provided 128 bits, but 12*11 == 132.  So where does the extra 4 bits of data
    come from?

    It comes from the first few bits of a SHA256 hash of the entropy, which is added to the end of
    the supplied 128 bits, to reach the required 132 bits: 132 / 11 == 12 words.

    This last 4 bits (up to 8 bits, for a 256-bit 24-word BIP-39) is checked, when validating the
    BIP-39 mnemonic.  Therefore, making up a random BIP-39 mnemonic will succeed only 1 / 16 times on
    average, due to an incorrect checksum 4-bit (16 == 2**4) .  Lets check:

    #+LATEX: {\scriptsize
    #+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :results raw drawer
    def random_words( n, count=100 ):
        for _ in range( count ):
            yield ' '.join( random.choice( bip39_english.wordlist ) for _ in range( n ))

    successes           = sum(
        bip39_english.check( m )
        for i,m in enumerate( random_words( 12, 10000 ))) / 100

    [[ f"Valid random 12-word mnemonics:" ]] + [
     [ f"{successes}%" ]] + [
     [ f"~ 1/{100/successes:.3}" ]]
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    :results:
    # Out[10]:
    | 0                               |

    | Valid random 12-word mnemonics: |
    | 6.2%                            |
    | ~ 1/16.1                        |
    :end:

    #+LATEX: }

    Sure enough, about 1/16 random 12-word phrases are valid BIP-39 mnemonics.  OK, we've got the
    contents of the BIP-39 phrase dialed in.  How is it used to generate accounts?

*** BIP-39 Mnemonic to Seed

    Unfortunately, we do *not* use the carefully preserved 128-bit entropy to generate the wallet!
    Nope, it is stretched to a 512-bit seed using PBKDF2 HMAC SHA512.  The normalized *text* (/not
    the entropy bytes/) of the 12-word mnemonic is then used (with a salt of "mnemonic" plus an
    optional passphrase, "" by default), to obtain the seed:

    #+LATEX: {\scriptsize
    #+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :results raw drawer
    seed                = bip39_english.to_seed( entropy_mnemonic )
    seedhex             = codecs.encode( seed, 'hex_codec' ).decode( 'ascii' )
    [
     [ f"{len(seed)*8}-bit seed:" ]] + [
     [ f"{seedhex[b*32:b*32+32]}" ]
     for b in range( len( seedhex ) // 32 )
    ]

    :end:

    #+LATEX: }

*** BIP-39 Seed to Address

    Finally, this 512-bit seed is used to derive HD wallet(s).  The HD Wallet key derivation process
    consumes whatever seed entropy is provided (512 bits in the case of BIP-39), and uses HMAC SHA512
    with a prefix of b"Bitcoin seed" to stretch the supplied seed entropy to 64 bytes (512 bits).
    Then, the HD Wallet *path* segments are iterated through, permuting the first 32 bytes of this
    material as the key with the second 32 bytes of material as the chain node, until finally the
    32-byte (256-bit) Ethereum account private key is produced.  We then use this private key to
    compute the rest of the Ethereum account details, such as its public address.

    #+LATEX: {\scriptsize
    #+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :results raw drawer
    path                = "m/44'/60'/0'/0/0"
    eth_hd		= slip39.account( seed, 'ETH', path )
    [
     [ f"{len(eth_hd.key)*4}-bit derived key at path {path!r}:" ]] + [
     [ f"{eth_hd.key}" ]] + [
     [ "... yields ..." ]] + [
     [ f"Ethereum address: {eth_hd.address}" ]
    ]
    #+END_SRC

    :end:

    #+LATEX: }

    Thus, we see that while the 12-word BIP-39 mnemonic careful preserves the original 128-bit
    entropy, this data is not directly used to derive the wallet private key and address.  Also,
    since an irreversible hash is used to derive the seed from the mnemonic, we can't reverse the
    process on the seed to arrive back at the BIP-39 mnemonic phrase.

*** SLIP-39 Entropy to Mnemonic

    Just like BIP-39 carefully preserves the original 128-bit entropy bytes in a single 12-word
    mnemonic phrase, SLIP-39 preserves the original 128-bit entropy in a /set/ of 30-word mnemonic
    phrases.

    #+LATEX: {\scriptsize

*** SLIP-39 Mnemonic to Seed

    Lets prove that we can actually recover the *original* entropy from the SLIP-39 recovery
    mnemonics; in this case, we've specified a SLIP-39 group_threshold of 2 groups, so we'll use 1
    mnemonic from Mine, and 2 from Fam:

    #+LATEX: {\scriptsize
    #+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :results raw drawer
    _,mnem_mine         = grps['Mine']
    _,mnem_fam          = grps['Fam']

    recseedhex          = codecs.encode( recseed, 'hex_codec' ).decode( 'ascii' )
    [
     [ f"{len(recseed)*8}-bit seed:" ]
    ] + [
     [ f"{recseedhex[b*32:b*32+32]}" ]
        for b in range( len( recseedhex ) // 32 )
    ]

    | ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff |
    :end:

    #+LATEX: }

*** SLIP-39 Seed to Address

    And we'll use the same style of code as for the BIP-39 example above, to derive the Ethereum
    address *directly* from this recovered 128-bit seed:

    #+LATEX: {\scriptsize
    #+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :results raw drawer
    receth		= slip39.account( recseed, 'ETH', path )
    [
     [ f"{len(receth.key)*4}-bit derived key at path {path!r}:" ]] + [
     [ f"{receth.key}" ]] + [
     [ "... yields ..." ]] + [
     [ f"Ethereum address: {receth.address}" ]
    ]
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    :results:
    # Out[19]:
    | 0                                                                |
    |------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | 256-bit derived key at path "m/44'/60'/0'/0/0":                  |
    | 6a2ec39aab88ec0937b79c8af6aaf2fd3c909e9a56c3ddd32ab5354a06a21a2b |
    | ... yields ...                                                   |
    | Ethereum address: 0x824b174803e688dE39aF5B3D7Cd39bE6515A19a1     |
    :end:

    #+LATEX: }

    And we see that we obtain the same Ethereum address =0x824b..1a2b= as we originally got from
    =slip39.create= above.  However, this is *not* the Ethereum wallet address obtained from BIP-39
    with exactly the same =0xFFFF...FF= entropy, which was =0xfc20..1B5E=.  This is due to the fact
    that BIP-39 does not use the recovered entropy to produce the seed like SLIP-39 does, but
    applies additional one-way hashing of the mnemonic to produce the seed.

** BIP-39 vs SLIP-39 Key Derivation Summary

   At no time in BIP-39 account derivation is the original 128-bit mnemonic entropy used directly in
   the derivation of the wallet key.  This differs from SLIP-39, which directly uses the 128-bit mnemonic
   entropy recovered from the SLIP-39 Shamir's Secret Sharing System recovery process to generate
   each HD Wallet account's private key.

   Furthermore, there is no point in the BIP-39 entropy to account generation where we *could*
   introduce a known 128-bit seed and produce a known Ethereum wallet from it, other than as the
   very beginning.

*** BIP-39 Backup via SLIP-39

    There is one approach which can preserve an original BIP-39 wallet address, using SLIP-39 mnemonics.

    It is clumsy, as it preserves the BIP-39 *output* 512-bit stretched seed, and the resultant
    59-word SLIP-39 mnemonics cannot be used (at present) with the Trezor hardware wallet.  They
    can, however, be used to recover the HD wallet private keys without access to the original
    BIP-39 mnemonic phrase -- you could generate and distribute a set of more secure SLIP-39
    mnemonic phrases, instead of trying to secure the original BIP-39 mnemonic.

    We'll use =slip39.recovery --bip39 ...= to recover the 512-bit stretched seed from BIP-39:

   #+LATEX: {\scriptsize
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash :exports both :results output
   ( python3 -m slip39.recovery --bip39 \
       --mnemonic "zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo wrong"

  and using [[https://www.python.org/downloads/][the official python.org/downloads installer]].

  Either of these methods will get you a =python3= executable running version 3.9+, usable for
  running the =slip39= module, and the =slip39.gui= GUI.

** The =slip39= Module

   To build the wheel and install =slip39= manually:
   : $ git clone git@github.com:pjkundert/python-slip39.git
   : $ make -C python-slip39 install

   To install from Pypi, including the optional requirements to run the PySimpleGUI/tkinter GUI,
   support serial I/O, and to support creating encrypted Ethereum JSON wallets:
   : $ python3 -m pip install slip39[gui,serial,json]

** The =slip39= GUI

   To install from Pypi, including the optional requirements to run the PySimpleGUI/tkinter GUI:
   : $ python3 -m pip install slip39[gui]

   Then, there are several ways to run the GUI:
   : $ python3 -m slip39.gui     # Execute the python slip39.gui module main method
   : $ slip39-gui                # Run the main function provided by the slip39.gui module
   
*** The macOS =SLIP-39.app= GUI

    You can build the native macOS =SLIP-39.app= App.

    This requires the official [[https://python.org/downloads][python.org/downloads]] installer; the homebrew python-tk@3.9 will not
    work for building the native app using either =PyInstaller=. (The =py2app= approach doesn't work
    in either version of Python).

    : $ git clone git@github.com:pjkundert/python-slip39.git
    : $ make -C python-slip39 app

* Dependencies

  Internally, python-slip39 project uses Trezor's [[https://gihub.com/trezor/python-shamir-mnemonic.git][python-shamir-mnemonic]] to encode the seed data to
  SLIP-39 phrases, [[https://github.com/meherett/python-hdwallet.git][python-hdwallet]] to convert seeds to ETH, BTC, LTC and DOGE wallets, and the
  Ethereum project's [[https://github.com/ethereum/eth-account][eth-account]] to produce encrypted JSON wallets for specified Ethereum accounts.

** The =python-shamir-mnemonic= API

   To use it directly, obtain , and install it, or run =python3 -m pip install shamir-mnemonic=.
